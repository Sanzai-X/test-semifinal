Sir Art, PLEASE READ THIS IF YOU CAN

we have implemented a login (THAT'S NOT FINALIZED YET BECAUSE IT'S RISKY AND IT'S UNSECURE), but it's proof that we can access the mongo db

also I suggest mongocompass and having a database named "ReviewWebsite" with the following collections: "restaurants" and "users" respectively. The files for the collections can be found 
"# test-repo"
